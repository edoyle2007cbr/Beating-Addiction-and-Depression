# Beating-Addiction-and-Depression
I hope I make it.

Depression is the worst thing that's ever happened to me. It's worse than any drug and I do not wish that on anybody even an enemy. That is 307 and I'm sitting in my garage smoking a joint having an anxiety attack why I'm such a loser and the drug is making me do it. It's an everlastin loop it's hard to explain I'm an internal battle I don't know if I'm going to win the war
